<h3>Description: <%=@routine.description%></h3>

<!--probably doing to want to modify table for routines at some point; will probably be better
to have a brief description plus a longer recipe-style description. more convenent to use the former
for a brief summary / subtitle for other users to see, then display longer description on a routine's show page -->
